### 2025 Market Leaders: Portfolio Performance Metrics

| Strategy | Wealth 2025 (Nominal) | Wealth 2024 (Real, Nov 2004 $) | Annualized Return (%) | Annualized Volatility (%) | Sharpe Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GMVP (Gross) | $17.44 | $9.44 | 14.58 | 14.92 | 1.177 |
| GMVP (Net) | $17.42 | $9.42 | 14.58 | 14.92 | 1.177 |
| MV (Gross) | $165.19 | $77.15 | 27.53 | 20.72 | 1.657 |
| MV (Net) | $165.01 | $77.07 | 27.53 | 20.72 | 1.657 |
| S&P 500 | $8.92 | $4.47 | 10.99 | 13.84 | 1.138 |


**Executive Summary - 2004 Cohort**
### The optimization strategies applied to 2004's market leaders—GE, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Citigroup—delivered disappointing results relative to passive S&P 500 investment. While both the Mean-Variance (MV) and Global Minimum Variance (GMVP) portfolios approximately doubled to tripled real wealth over the 20-year period (Nov 2004 - Nov 2024), a passive S&P 500 investment quadrupled to quintupled real wealth over the same period.

### Key Metrics Analysis
Risk-Adjusted Performance: The S&P 500 demonstrated superior risk-adjusted returns with a Sharpe ratio of 1.138, significantly outperforming the MV portfolio (0.712) and GMVP portfolio (0.575). This suggests that diversified broad market exposure provided better compensation for risk taken.

### Volatility Differential
The S&P 500 exhibited lower volatility (13.84%) compared to both optimization strategies: MV portfolio (17.75%) and GMVP portfolio (15.40%). Notably, the GMVP's explicit objective to minimize volatility succeeded in reducing portfolio standard deviation relative to MV, but both still exceeded broad market volatility.

### Impact of Transaction Costs and Inflation
Transaction Costs: Annual rebalancing with 10 basis points (0.1%) friction costs had only a marginal impact on overall performance, confirming that transaction costs were not a material performance drag over this period.

### Inflation Effects
Inflation played a decisive role. On a nominal basis, the S&P 500 value grew more than 8-fold, but in real terms (constant Nov 2004 dollars), growth was 4-5 fold. This erosion of purchasing power affected all three strategies, but the S&P 500's superior absolute returns offset inflationary effects more effectively.

### Performance Dynamics Through Time
An interesting temporal dynamic emerged: Through November 2024, the GMVP portfolio slightly outperformed the MV portfolio on a real-value basis. However, extending the analysis through November 2025 reversed this pattern, with the MV portfolio gaining additional ground. This reversal reflects the different risk profiles of the two strategies and their sensitivity to market conditions in the final year of analysis.


**Executive Summary - 2025 Cohort**
### The retrospective analysis of 2025's market leaders—Microsoft, NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway—investing over the same 21-year period reveals dramatically superior outcomes compared to 2004's cohort. Remarkably, both optimization strategies vastly outperformed the S&P 500 when applied to these five dominant 2025 companies.

### Real wealth growth (Nov 2004 - Nov 2024)
The 2025 cohort demonstrated extraordinary appreciation, with the MV portfolio achieving 77-fold growth and the GMVP portfolio achieving 9-fold growth, compared to the S&P 500's 4-5 fold growth in real terms.

### Key Metrics Analysis
Risk-Adjusted Performance: Contrary to the 2004 results, both optimization strategies outperformed the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. The MV portfolio achieved a Sharpe ratio of 1.657 and the GMVP achieved 1.177, both exceeding the S&P 500's 1.138. This stark reversal reflects the exceptional growth of these five companies relative to broader market diversification.

### Volatility Trade-offs
The S&P 500 maintained the lowest volatility at 13.84%. The GMVP portfolio, with its explicit volatility minimization objective, achieved nearly comparable volatility (14.92%), demonstrating effective risk control. The MV portfolio, prioritizing return optimization, accepted higher volatility (20.72%)—a deliberate trade-off to capture the extraordinary growth potential of this concentrated cohort.

### Impact of Transaction Costs and Inflation
Transaction Costs: Consistent with the 2004 analysis, 10 basis points annual friction costs had minimal impact on overall performance, validating the assumption that transaction costs represent negligible drags relative to the return dynamics of these strategies.

### Inflation Effects
The inflation adjustment reveals the magnitude of real economic gains achieved. On a nominal basis, the GMVP portfolio appreciated 15-fold and the MV portfolio 165-fold over 21 years. On a real basis (Nov 2004 dollars), these figures adjusted to 9.44-fold and 77-fold respectively, demonstrating that while inflation eroded all returns, the 2025 cohort's growth substantially exceeded inflationary effects.

### Strategy Dynamics and Optimization Trade-offs
MV Portfolio Outperformance: The Mean-Variance portfolio consistently outperformed GMVP whether measured through November 2024 or November 2025. On a real basis, the MV portfolio achieved 77-fold wealth growth over 20 years compared to 9-fold for GMVP. On a nominal basis over 21 years, MV multiplied wealth by 165-fold versus 17-fold for GMVP.
